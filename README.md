[![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Apache%202.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://github.com/droibit/prefbinding/blob/develop/LICENSE)

A collection of UI libraries and a parser for displaying open-source licenses in Android applications.  
Built with Jetpack Compose and compatible with the [OSS Licenses Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/google/play-services-plugins/tree/main/oss-licenses-plugin).

## Overview

This library provides several modules to help you display open-source licenses in your applications:

- [ui-compose-material3](./ui-compose-material3): UI components for mobile apps([adaptive apps](https://developer.android.com/adaptive-apps)) using Material 3 design system
- [ui-wear-compose-material](./ui-wear-compose-material): UI components for Wear OS apps using Wear Material design system
- [ui-wear-compose-material3](./ui-wear-compose-material3): UI components for Wear OS apps using Wear Material 3 design system
- [parser](./parser): Core module that parses license information generated by the [OSS Licenses Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/google/play-services-plugins/tree/main/oss-licenses-plugin)

Each module can be used independently based on your app's needs.

Additionally, the following Gradle plugin is available:

- [licensee-bridge](./gradle-plugin/licensee-bridge): A Gradle plugin that transforms [Licensee](https://github.com/cashapp/licensee) artifacts to a format compatible with the OSS Licenses plugin

## Installation

### Choose a License Data Generation Plugin

Before using the UI components, you need to set up license data generation. Choose **one** of the following options:

#### Option 1: OSS Licenses Gradle Plugin

Add Google's OSS Licenses Gradle Plugin by following the official [documentation](https://github.com/google/play-services-plugins/tree/main/oss-licenses-plugin#add-the-gradle-plugins).

#### Option 2: Licensee Bridge Gradle Plugin

Alternatively, use the [Licensee Bridge Gradle Plugin](./gradle-plugin/licensee-bridge) which transforms license data collected by [Licensee](https://github.com/cashapp/licensee) into a compatible format.

For detailed configuration instructions, see the [documentation](./gradle-plugin/licensee-bridge/README.md).

### Add OSS Licenses Components to Your App

Add the following code to your build.gradle.

```kotlin
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  // For apps using `androidx.compose.material3:material3`
  implementation("io.github.droibit.oss-licenses-android:ui-compose-material3:0.7.1")

  // UI components for Wear OS apps
  // If using `androidx.wear.compose:compose-material`
  implementation("io.github.droibit.oss-licenses-android:ui-wear-compose-material:0.7.1")
  // or
  // If using `androidx.wear.compose:compose-material3`
  implementation("io.github.droibit.oss-licenses-android:ui-wear-compose-material3:0.7.1")

  // For custom implementations, use only the parser
  implementation("io.github.droibit.oss-licenses-android:parser:0.7.1")
}
```

## Usage

### Mobile Apps

Launch the license screen in mobile apps using Compose Material 3:

```kotlin
import com.github.droibit.oss_licenses.ui.compose.material3.OssLicensesActivity

startActivity(OssLicensesActivity.createIntent(context))
```

#### Migrating from `play-services-oss-licenses`

If you're currently using the [Google Play Services OSS Licenses library](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/opensource), you can migrate to this library by:

1. Remove the dependency:

```diff
-implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-oss-licenses'
```

2. Update your code to use the new Activity:

```diff
-import com.google.android.gms.oss.licenses.OssLicensesMenuActivity
+import com.github.droibit.oss_licenses.ui.compose.material3.OssLicensesActivity

-startActivity(Intent(context, OssLicensesMenuActivity::class.java));
+startActivity(OssLicensesActivity.createIntent(context))
```

### Wear OS Apps

Launch the license screen in Wear OS apps using your preferred design system:

> [!TIP]  
> The `WearableOssLicensesActivity` supports the `com.google.android.gms.oss.licenses.ACTION_SHOW_LICENSE` intent action, allowing it to be launched from the app info screen on some modern Wear OS devices.

#### Using Material Design

Use the Wear Compose implementation:

```kotlin
import com.github.droibit.oss_licenses.ui.wear.compose.material.WearableOssLicensesActivity

startActivity(WearableOssLicensesActivity.createIntent(context))
```

#### Using Material Design 3

Use the Wear Compose Material3 implementation:

```kotlin
import com.github.droibit.oss_licenses.ui.wear.compose.material3.WearableOssLicensesActivity

startActivity(WearableOssLicensesActivity.createIntent(context))
```
